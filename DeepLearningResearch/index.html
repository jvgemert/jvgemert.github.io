Machine learning: application independent;

Deep learning: coupled to the application.

# What has deep learning ever done for us?

--

### The good
- Excellent representations for unmeasurable data (images/text/speech/...)
- Available code frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras)
- Models, code and pre-trained features often shared

--

### The Bad

- Massive data
- High compute
- May not converge (and unclear why)

--

### The Ugly

- Critically sensitive to hyperparameter tuners
- Bold number fetishism 
- Reproducibility difficulty (even with code)

# Research organization I

--

1. **Take full responsibility**, You are in charge of everything. Your adviser's role is to advise, the final responsibility remains yours. 

--

2. **No dependencies on third parties**, Promised datasets, experts, constraints, or other agreements have to be there *before* you start.

--

3. **Meet your adviser**, try to see your adviser at least once every 2 weeks; once per week is better.

--

4. **Focus your adviser**, meeting time is limited. It is your responsibility to choose to discuss what benefits you most.


---
# Research organization II

--

5. **Do not take critique personal**, all feedback is meant to improve and benefit you.  Do not fight the feedback, even if you think it is wrong: Make a note, and think about why your supervisor gave this feedback.

--

6. **If you disagree, propose something**, It's OK to disagree with a suggestion of your adviser, but if you do: propose something else. 

--

7. **Analyze**, when presenting (intermediate) results, give an interpretation and conclusions.

--

8. **Suggest solutions**, when encountering research or organizational problems: suggest a solution.


---
# Research process I

--

1. **One main research question**, it may change over time, pursue a single topic: try to write it down.

--

2. **Minimize 3rd party components**, (object detector, pose estimator..) Minimize effort, it should not matter, modular.

--

3. **Validate published work**, Not obvious if published work generalizes to your problem. There may be subtleties: Validate this.

--

4. **Prioritize idea breaking**, Start with the greatest risk. Do not invest only to find out months later that the main idea did not work. 

--

5. **Depth-first instead of breadth-first**, No deep sub-topics, do the minimum. First full version ASAP to validate your idea. More baselines/variants/datasets later. 



---
# Research process II

--

6. **One Experiment answers a single question**, write answer down before the experiment. Validate.

--

7. **Show proof of concept**, start with fully controlled (possibly toy) dataset of 'the simplest case possible' which should only vary in the relevant manner. To validate problem and your solution.

--

8. **Exploratory experiments take max 1 night**, if it takes 1 week: only 24 in 6 months. Minimize experimental time to answer more questions.

--

9. **Change only 1 variable**, if multiple variables change, it is not possible to determine the cause of an effect.

--

10. **Debug your scientific ideas and your code**, Test ideas and test code every time you make a change. Assume you made a mistake somewhere, gather independent proof that it is correct




---
# Research mentality

--

1. **The critical reviewer**, explain your research to a devil on your shoulder who wants to reject everything. 

--

2. **Your adviser does not have the answer**, By definition, research has not been done before. No list of ToDos: We'll find them together.

--

3. **Be consistent**, Assumptions you make in one part of your research should not suddenly change in another part.

--

4. **Question everything**, Take a step back, and think about what you are really doing.

--

5. **Simple is strong**, simple is more powerful than complex. Explain your topic to your mother, if she doesn't understand: its too complex.

--

6. **Limitations**, showing insight where it fails is strong. The goal of research is understanding.

--

7. **Write early and often**, helps to make thoughts concrete. Writing always takes longer than you think.

--

8. **Not' Eureka'  But 'thatâ€™s strange'**, (Asimov) is the most exciting phrase in research. It becomes most interesting when expectations break.
