	<h2>My research guidelines</h2>


<UL>
<li><b>My guidelines</b>&nbsp;  
My collected <a href="ResearchGuidelinesInDL.pdf">research guidelines</a> contain several parts about doing research. They involve: research organization, a storyline narrative, writing, meetings, presenting, posters, reviews/rebuttals.
Please read them, if you are doing research with me.
Individual sections are available here:
<UL>
<li><a href="research.pdf">Research organization</a></li>
<li><a href="writing.pdf">Writing</a></li>
<li><a href="storyline.pdf">The storyline: the beating heart of empirical ML/DL research</a>; here is a single image <a href="storyline-fig.pdf">storyline visualization</a>.</li>
<li><a href="meetings.pdf">Research meetings</a></li>
<li><a href="presentation.pdf">Presentations</a></li>
<li><a href="poster.pdf">Posters</a></li>
<li><a href="reviewRebut.pdf">Reviewing and rebuttals</a>; rebuttal examples: <a href="rebuttalExamples/rebuttalExample1.pdf">Example 1</a>,   <a href="rebuttalExamples/rebuttalExample2.pdf">Example 2</a>,  <a href="rebuttalExamples/rebuttalExample3.pdf">Example 3</a>.</li>
</UL>
<p/></li>


<li><b>Research paper template.</b>&nbsp;
Fill in this <a href="paper_skeleton.rtf">paper_skeleton</a> when writing a research paper.
For everybody who is writing a paper or thesis with me. This template helps to organize our thoughts and adds structure to the writing process. Here is an <a href="paper_skeleton_example_CVPR20.rtf">example skeleton</a> for one of my <a href="pub/kayhanCVPR20translationInvarianceCNN.pdf">papers</a>.
<p/></li>

<li><b>Grant proposal writing.</b>&nbsp;
My presentation on <a href="Fairytales and successful grant proposals.pdf">Fairytales.. ..and successful individual grant proposals</a>.<br/>
<p/></li>

<h2>Other research guidelines</h2>

<UL>


<li><b>Write/review/rebut.</b>&nbsp; 
Excellent advice on <a href="https://www.jakobfoerster.com/how-to-ml-paper">Writing a paper</a>, on  <a href="https://www.jakobfoerster.com/how-to-review-ml-paper">reviewing</a>, and on how to  <a href="https://www.jakobfoerster.com/how-to-rebuttal-ml-paper">rebut</a>  reviews. 
<p/></li>



<li><b>Deep Learning.</b>&nbsp; 
Are you training deep networks? Here is a <a href="https://minitorch.github.io/">diy teaching library</a>. Hyper parameter tuning is then essential but can be a time sink and a source of frustration. Here is one great resource: <a href="https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook">Deep Learning Tuning Playbook</a>, and another one is  <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">A Recipe for Training Neural Networks</a>. 
<p/></li>


<li> <b>Experiment tracking.</b>&nbsp;  
The <a href="https://wandb.ai/site">Weights and Biases</a> tool for organizing and tracking network training is the key to retain your sanity while running deep learning experiments.<p/></li>



<li><b>Papers with code.</b>&nbsp; 
Reproducing published research from scratch can be quite difficult and also time consuming. Here is a great list of papers and benchmarks that have code available: <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">Papers with code</a>. 
<p/></li>


<li> <b>Science in deep learning.</b>&nbsp;  
Is deep learning science? The answer might depends on what you do. One indicator for doing science is that science aims to advance our knowledge, which makes it a core property to identfiy which parts already existed, and which part is advanced by your work (ie: how and what is "Related Work"). See  <a href="https://togelius.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-differences-between-tinkering-and.html">The differences between tinkering and research</a>. <p/></li>

<li> <b>Scientific virtues.</b>&nbsp;  
Science depends on tools, methods, math, programming, etc. Yet, for doing science, the attitude is perhaps equally important:  <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/02/10/the-scientific-virtues/">The Scientific Virtues</a> argues for: Arrogance, Laziness, Carefreeness, Beauty, Rebellion, Humor.<p/></li>




<li> <b>Do good research, run a great lab.</b>&nbsp;  
Excellent advice about <a href="https://www.thecomputationalphotographer.net/2022/09/do-good-research-run-a-great-lab/">what is important in doing research</a>.<p/></li>



<li> <b>Exploring literature.</b>&nbsp;  
The <a href="https://www.researchrabbit.ai/">ResearchRabbit</a> tool helps for literature search. Referral code: vKNw521 <p/></li>


<li><b>What is a good paper?</b>&nbsp;
Prof. Bill Freeman explains the mores in our field in <a href="https://billf.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/cvprPapers.pdf">How to write a CVPR paper (PDF)</a>. 
<p/></li>


<li><b>Writing for ML.</b>&nbsp;
The importance of writing through <a href="http://approximatelycorrect.com/2018/01/29/heuristics-technical-scientific-writing-machine-learning-perspective/">Heuristics for Scientific Writing (a Machine Learning Perspective)</a>. 
<p/></li>

<li><b>Rebuttals.</b>&nbsp;
How to write a rebuttal to paper reviews: <a href="https://medium.com/@deviparikh/how-we-write-rebuttals-dc84742fece1">How we write rebuttals</a>. 
<p/></li>


<li><b>What is a paper?</b>&nbsp;
Papers have two parts: 1. A technical contribution and 2. a motivation why the paper is important: <a href="https://aaronhertzmann.com/2020/07/13/rebuttals.html">Technical paper rebuttals aren't just for factual errors</a>. 
<p/></li>



<li><b>Related work.</b>&nbsp;
Excellent advice on <a href="https://niklaselmqvist.medium.com/writing-the-literature-review-52798b986676">How to write the Related Work section</a> of a scientific article. 
<p/></li>


<li><b>Deconstruct your research ideas (NeurIPS talk).</b>&nbsp;
Strive to understand; clear insight make things simpler:   
<a href="https://slideslive.com/38938218/the-importance-of-deconstruction">The Importance of Deconstruction</a>.
<p/></li>

<li><b>Stress in research.</b>&nbsp;
A series by Charles Sutton about 
<a href="http://www.theexclusive.org/tag/stress%20in%20research/">research stress</a>.
<p/></li>



<li><b>Stupidity.</b>&nbsp;
In research, by definition, we don't know what we are doing: If we knew the answer we needn't do the research. This is quite a different mindset from 'reproducing' knowledge, as often measured by course grades. See <a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771">The importance of stupidity in scientific research</a>.
<p/></li>

<li><b>You and your research.</b>&nbsp;
Richard Hamming (from the Hamming window) has good advice on <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">You and your research</a>, there is also a <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/02/14/you-and-your-research/">video</a> available.
<p/></li>

<li><b>Research results.</b>&nbsp;
Obtaining research results can be quite frustrating: <a href="http://theorangeduck.com/page/reproduce-their-results">What I Wish I Knew as a Graduate Student</a>.
<p/></li>

<li><b>What is important in academia.</b>&nbsp;
An academic should give, educate and inspire: <a href="https://alternative-democracy-research.org/2020/04/20/what-was-important/">Looking back: What was important?</a>.
<p/></li>







</UL>

<h2>Tools</h2> 
<UL>

<li><b>Figures.</b>&nbsp; 
Try to script all graphs/figures that you create. Yes: All. Your adviser may ask for a completely different version of a figure, and automating it prevents lots of manual re-doing. I prefer 
<a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html">Matplotlib</a>; it can output high-quality PDF figures and graphs that can directly be included in pdflatex. 
<p/></li>

<li><b>Manual figures and posters.</b>&nbsp;
If you really cannot automate the figure, and you really think you just need 1 version, then I recommend <a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> for high quality vector graphics (which also export to PDF). 
<p/></li>

<li><b>Version control.</b>&nbsp;
Use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> for version control of your latex documents but also of your code
<p/></li>
