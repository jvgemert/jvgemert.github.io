	<h2>Doing a MSc thesis at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in Computer Vision / Deep learning </h2>

I try to give MSc students a sense of doing real, cutting edge research and I have <a href="pub/index.html">published</a> in top venues based on a MSc thesis.</br>
I exclusively supervise MSc thesis topics on visual data (images, video). 
<p/> 


<b>First meeting.</b> <br/> 
For our first meeting I want you to prepare the following, which we will discuss in turn: <p/>

<UL>

<li> Information: I will need your first name, last name, email address, formal thesis starting date and student number.

<li> Show me that you have created a git project named 'mscYourName' with 3 folders: 'code' (for your code), 'thesis' (for your latex files), 'notes' (for our agreements). Upload this project as  a <u>private</u> git repository on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a> and gave me full access (read+write+admin) (through 'settings', and 'User and group access'). My bitbucket ID is: jvgemert. </li>


<li> Add a text file to the 'notes' folder on the git with the name: "planning.txt" with a planning time line (give the expected dates) of when required forms, committee meetings, milestones, green light moments, etc., are due. For EWI students this is the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/eemcs-student-portal/education/graduation-policy-msc/summary-of-procedure/">procedure</a> and *you* will have to use these <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/eemcs-student-portal/education/forms/">forms</a>. </li>

<li> Bring all the required forms to the meeting. (For EWI students: TEP and IEP forms?).</li>

<li> Show me that you have taken at least one of the following courses: pattern recognition; computer vision; deep learning.</li>


<li> Read my research <a href="http://jvgemert.github.io/links.html">guidelines</a>.</li>

<li> Write your MSc Thesis in the style of an academic article. This means you will need two parts: 1. The article; preferably in double column CVPR-style Latex format and 2. Supplemental material that provides the background of the thesis. Here are some <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/w8i91j8oyq81h22/egThesisAsArticle.zip?dl=0">examples</a>. For the writing: follow my writing <a href="http://jvgemert.github.io/links.html">guidelines</a>. If you submit something to get feedback, use the "review" format that has line numbers.

<li> Prepare your scope: think about what kind of Computer Vision topics you would prefer to work on. Note that it has to be related to visual data (images, video).</li>


<li> We meet in <a href="index.html">my office</a>, make an appointment with me <a href="https://calendly.com/jvgemert/30min/">online</a>.</li>

</UL>


<b>During your thesis work.</b></br>


<UL>
<li> For meetings with me follow my research meeting <a href="http://jvgemert.github.io/meeting.html">protocol</a>. You are responsible for scheduling meetings and your own progress. </li>
<li> Every 2 weeks we have scheduled MSc student presentations (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1ov95jW9psCeDkZzgeBK7TcH78t_QVVFCh4KwppA6o/">schedule</a>). You are required to present a few times (follow my presentation <a href="http://jvgemert.github.io/links.html">guidelines</a>.)  and to attend often, if you cannot make it send an email to Saskia Peters (S.Peters@tudelft.nl). The benefit for you is that you can practice your presentation a few times before your final defense and that you get feedback and insight in what others are doing. </li>
<li> Every 3 months we have a few hours of poster presentations where the Bio-Informatics lab, Pattern Recognition lab, and Computer Vision lab members present work to each other, followed by drinks. You will be expected to present your work during the Computer Vision posters. The benefit for you is: independent feedback from experts, insight in all research in the group, experience in presenting your topic to others.</li>
<li> If you are interested, feel free to join our "coffee talks": Typically every Tue/Wed/Thu in room Ritchy at the 5th floor someone presents a ML/PR/DL/CV paper in 10 minutes. </li>
<li> Do not forget to keep everything in your git up to date on bitbucket</li>
<li> Whenever you are stuck: First re-read my <a href="http://jvgemert.github.io/links.html">guidelines</a>.</li>

</UL>




<b>Defense.</b></br> 
The formal requirements (forms, timeline, green-light moment, etc.) vary per faculty. You are responsible for managing these requirements. The procedure during the defense is approximately as follows:

<UL>
<li> You give a presentation of around 25 minutes (follow my presentation <a href="http://jvgemert.github.io/links.html">guidelines</a>.) </li>
<li> Some questions from the audience. </li>
<li> The committee and the candidate have a non-public private discussion where each committee member has approximately 10 minutes to ask detailed questions. </li>
<li> The candidate leaves the room, and the committee decides on a  <a href="http://jvgemert.github.io/thesis_form.pdf">weighted</a> grade, based on this  <a href="http://jvgemert.github.io/thesis_matrix.pdf">matrix.</a> </li>
<li> The committee motivates the grade to the candidate. </li>
<li> The diploma ceremony proceeds in public. </li>
</UL>
