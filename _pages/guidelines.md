#### My guidelines on Fundamental empirical understanding-based deep learning research.

I do not believe in rigid rules, yet, I do have a set of guiding principles. My collected [research guidelines](/ResearchGuidelinesInDL.pdf) contain several parts about doing research. They involve: research organization, writing, the storyline, meetings, presenting, posters, reviews/rebuttals. Please read them, if you are doing research with me. Individual sections are available here:
    
*   [Research organization](/research.pdf). About organizing the research.
*   [Writing](/writing.pdf). Common writing pitfals. Please check these writing guidelines before asking for my feedback :sweat_smile:.
*   [The storyline](storyline.pdf). The beating heart of empirical understanding-based deep learning research. See also this [storyline visualization](storyline-fig.pdf).
*   [Research meetings](/meetings.pdf). How to organize research meetings and make the most of your time with your advisor.
*   [Presentations](/presentation.pdf). Guidelines and common presentation pitfals.
*   [Posters](/poster.pdf). Guidelines and common presentation pitfals.
*   [Reviewing and rebuttals](reviewRebut.pdf); on reviewing and writing a rebuttal/response answer to a review. Here are some examples of such a rebuttal: [Example 1](assets/pdf/rebuttalExample1.pdf), [Example 2](assets/pdfrebuttalExample2.pdf), [Example 3](assets/pdf/rebuttalExample3.pdf).

#### Research paper template.  

Fill in this [paper\_skeleton](assets/pdf/paper_skeleton.rtf) when writing a research paper. For everybody who is writing a paper or thesis with me. This template helps to organize our thoughts and adds structure to the writing process. Here is an [example skeleton](assets/pdf/paper_skeleton_example_CVPR20.rtf) for one of my [papers](pub/kayhanCVPR20translationInvarianceCNN.pdf).
    
#### Grant proposal writing.

My view on individual grant proposals as a presentation called [Fairytales.. ..and successful individual grant proposals](/assets/pdf/Fairytales and successful grant proposals.pdf).

## Other research guidelines


<p/>



*   **Reasons to do a PhD**. A PhD is a significant commitment that can offer unique opportunities for intellectual growth, research training, and career development - but it's not for everyone and shouldn't be. Here's a couple of models of [when a PhD can be valuable](https://www.eugenevinitsky.com/posts/reasons-to-do-a-phd/)


*   **Paper writing**. The Why and How of paper writing: [How to Write Papers](https://visionbook.mit.edu/how_to_write_papers.html)


* **Boring writing**. Tips for how to write consistently [boring scientiﬁc literature](https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15674.x) (ie: what *not* to do :smile:)


*   **Write/review/rebut.**  Excellent advice on [Writing a paper](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/how-to-ml-paper), on [reviewing](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/how-to-review-ml-paper), and on how to [rebut](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/how-to-rebuttal-ml-paper) reviews.
    
*   **Deep Learning.**  Are you training deep networks? Here is a [diy teaching library](https://minitorch.github.io/). Hyper parameter tuning is then essential but can be a time sink and a source of frustration. Here is one great resource: [Deep Learning Tuning Playbook](https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook), and another one is [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/).
    
*   **Experiment tracking.**  The [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) tool for organizing and tracking network training is the key to retain your sanity while running deep learning experiments.
    
*   **Papers with code.**  Reproducing published research from scratch can be quite difficult and also time consuming. Here is a great list of papers and benchmarks that have code available: [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/).
    
*   **Science in deep learning.**  Is deep learning science? The answer might depends on what you do. One indicator for doing science is that science aims to advance our knowledge, which makes it a core property to identfiy which parts already existed, and which part is advanced by your work (ie: how and what is "Related Work"). See [The differences between tinkering and research](https://togelius.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-differences-between-tinkering-and.html).
    
*   **Scientific virtues.**  Science depends on tools, methods, math, programming, etc. Yet, for doing science, the attitude is perhaps equally important: [The Scientific Virtues](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/02/10/the-scientific-virtues/) argues for: Arrogance, Laziness, Carefreeness, Beauty, Rebellion, Humor.
    
*   **Do good research, run a great lab.**  Excellent advice about [what is important in doing research](https://www.thecomputationalphotographer.net/2022/09/do-good-research-run-a-great-lab/).
    
*   **Exploring literature.**  The [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/) tool helps for literature search. Referral code: vKNw521
    
*   **What is a good paper?**  Prof. Bill Freeman explains the mores in our field in [How to write a CVPR paper (PDF)](https://billf.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/cvprPapers.pdf).
    
*   **Writing for ML.**  The importance of writing through [Heuristics for Scientific Writing (a Machine Learning Perspective)](http://approximatelycorrect.com/2018/01/29/heuristics-technical-scientific-writing-machine-learning-perspective/).
    
*   **Rebuttals.**  How to write a rebuttal to paper reviews: [How we write rebuttals](https://medium.com/@deviparikh/how-we-write-rebuttals-dc84742fece1).
    
*   **What is a paper?**  Papers have two parts: 1. A technical contribution and 2. a motivation why the paper is important: [Technical paper rebuttals aren't just for factual errors](https://aaronhertzmann.com/2020/07/13/rebuttals.html).
    
*   **Related work.**  Excellent advice on [How to write the Related Work section](https://niklaselmqvist.medium.com/writing-the-literature-review-52798b986676) of a scientific article.
    
*   **Deconstruct your research ideas (NeurIPS talk).**  Strive to understand; clear insight make things simpler: [The Importance of Deconstruction](https://slideslive.com/38938218/the-importance-of-deconstruction).
    
*   **Stress in research.**  A series by Charles Sutton about [research stress](http://www.theexclusive.org/tag/stress%20in%20research/).
    
*   **Stupidity.**  In research, by definition, we don't know what we are doing: If we knew the answer we needn't do the research. This is quite a different mindset from 'reproducing' knowledge, as often measured by course grades. See [The importance of stupidity in scientific research](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771).
    
*   **You and your research.**  Richard Hamming (from the Hamming window) has good advice on [You and your research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html), there is also a [video](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/02/14/you-and-your-research/) available.
    
*   **Research results.**  Obtaining research results can be quite frustrating: [What I Wish I Knew as a Graduate Student](http://theorangeduck.com/page/reproduce-their-results).
    
*   **What is important in academia.**  An academic should give, educate and inspire: [Looking back: What was important?](https://alternative-democracy-research.org/2020/04/20/what-was-important/).

## Tools


<p/>
    
    
*   **Figures.**  Try to script all graphs/figures that you create. Yes: All. Your adviser may ask for a completely different version of a figure, and automating it prevents lots of manual re-doing. I prefer [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html); it can output high-quality PDF figures and graphs that can directly be included in pdflatex.
    
*   **Manual figures and posters.**  If you really cannot automate the figure, and you really think you just need 1 version, then I recommend [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) for high quality vector graphics (which also export to PDF).
    
*   **Version control.**  Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control of your latex documents but also of your code
